    This program does shrinking by deleteing alternate rows and columns to 
    give a zoom out effect to the image. This method is corresponding to 
    "replication" method used for image scaling.
    Usage: 
    requires lena_color.tif in the directory to function
    on left mouse click it displays a box within the image that shows zoomed
    effect on pixels in vicinity of the mouse click.
    press 'c' to exit
    press 'r' to reset image back to normal
